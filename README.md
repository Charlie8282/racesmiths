# Racesmiths

 This application is used to orginize sim-racing championships.  After registration you can browse the clubs and request to join or create your own club to take on the role of *ClubManager*, where you can then invite other members and create championships of your own. The point is to have a place to easily keep up with the results of a series of scheduled races that the *ClubManager* conducts and enters the finishing results of each *event*.  The application will automate the acumulation of points for each *driver*, based on a chosen points system, and move them into position as each new event's points are entered from largest to smallest.  There will be many options to choose from along the way to make this application universal to any game that a sim racer might use.  
 
 > As a side note I would like to eventually have real time results for as many sim racing games as possible so that the user (*ClubManager*) doesn't have to enter the results of the events.
 
## Getting Started

**Registering**

 Enter email, Gamertag and desired password.  Check email and click the confirm link to confirm email.  This will save the user to the datbase as a *Newuser*.  Upon log in the user is sent to the "Infield" where there will be a list of recent activity among other clubs.

**Club Manager Actions**

 First, as a *CM* you add *drivers*. When they have accepted the invitation via the email that they regeistered with they move to the role of *driver*.  The *CM* will then create a championship where they can select the needed options for scheduling all of the Races/Heats/Events and all available in game conditions.  


> As the *CM* creates a championship they will have to then select a points system, which will be the Number of points for first place and how the points will decend from there.  Include a bonus section where the *CM* can add any desired bonus points for any given Race/Heat/Event to each of the following presets.

1. Qualifying and Race: 
- Inputs available for a qualifying and race session.
2. Split Race(2 races):
- Inputs for w/qualifying or without
