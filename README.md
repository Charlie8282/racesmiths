# Racesmiths
## Description:
### Getting Started
 This application is used to orginize sim-racing championships.  After registration you can create your own club to take on the role of *ClubManager*, where you can then invite other members and create championships of your own. The point is to have a place to easily keep up with the results of a series of scheduled races that the *ClubManager* conducts and enters the finishing results of each *event*.  The application will automate the acumulation of points for each *driver*, based on a chosen points system, and move them into position as each new event's points are entered from largest to smallest.  
 
 > As a side note I would like to eventually have real time results for as many sim racing games as possible so that the user (*ClubManager*) doesn't have to enter the results of the events.  
 
### Club Manager actions
 First action as a *CM* is to add *drivers*.  Once they have registered as a *NewUser* the *CM* can send them an invitation to the club. When they have accepted the invitation via the email that they regeistered with they move to the role of *driver*.   
 
Universal to all games with optional presets to add conditions that induce closer points and more compitetive racing.  These options will include but not be limited to:
- Qual and Race: Inputs available for a qualifying and race session
