# Racesmiths

 This application is used to orginize sim-racing championships.  After registration you can browse the clubs and request to join or create your own club to take on the role of *ClubManager*, where you can then invite other members and create championships of your own. The point is to have a place to easily keep up with the results of a series of scheduled races that the *ClubManager* conducts and enters the finishing results of each *event*.  The application will have a *Scorecard* automate the acumulation of points for each *driver*, based on a chosen points system, and move them into position as each new event's points are entered from largest to smallest.  There will be many options to choose from along the way to make this application universal to any game that a sim racer might use.  There are 4 different roles for this app: NewUser, Driver, ClubManager, and Admin.
 
 > As a side note I would like to eventually have real time results for as many sim racing games as possible so that the *ClubManager* doesn't have to enter the results of the events.
 
## Getting Started

**Registering**

 Enter email, Gamertag and desired password.  Check email and click the confirm link to confirm email.  This will save the user to the datbase as a *Newuser*.  Upon log in the user is sent to the "Infield" where there will be a list of recent activity among other clubs, a "Create Club" link, and a "Browse Clubs" link.  If the user sends a join request to a Club and is then confirmed as joining said Club they move to the role of "Driver".  If the user Creates their own club, they will take on the role of ClubManager, but only of the club they have created.  They will still have a role of driver when visiting a club created by another user.

**Club Manager Actions**

 First, as a *CM* you add *drivers*. When they have accepted the invitation via the email that they regeistered with they move to the role of *driver*.  The *CM* will then create a championship where they can select the needed options for scheduling all of the Races/Heats/Events and all available in game conditions.  


 As the *CM* clicks to create a Championship they can select a blank scorecard to customize the points as they wish and add them in manually.  There is also a "presets" section where the user will be met with multiple options to customize the scorecard.  This is the basic run down of creating a Championship from the start:
 
 > Clicking either Blank or Presets will bring you to this initial set up screen:
 
 - Championship Name
 - Start and End date
 - Maximum amount of drivers
 - Teams (Y/N)
 - Name of Game being used
 -
