## Description:
**Getting Started**
 This application is used to orginize sim-racing championships.  After registration you can create your own club to take on the role of *ClubManager*, where you can then invite other members and create championships of your own. The point is to have a place to easily keep up with the results of a series of scheduled races that the *ClubManager* conducts and enters the finishing results of each *event*.  The application will automate the acumulation of points for each *driver*, based on a chosen points system, and move them into position as each new event's points are entered from largest to smallest.  This "Scoreboard" 
 
 > As a side note I would like to eventually have real time results for as many sim racing games as possible so that the user (*ClubManager*) doesn't have to enter the results of the events.  

**Registering**
 Enter email, Gamertag and desired password.  Check email and click the confirm link to confirm email.  This will save the user to the datbase as a *Newuser*.  User can now browse Clubs that have been created or create a club of their own.

**Club Manager Actions**
 First, as a *CM* you add *drivers*.  Once a user has registered as a *NewUser* the *CM* can send them an invitation to the club, or they can . When they have accepted the invitation via the email that they regeistered with they move to the role of *driver*.  The *CM* will then create a championship where they can select the needed options for scheduling all of the Races/Heats/Events and all available in game conditions.

> As the *CM* creates a championship they will have to then select a points system, which will be the Number of points for first place and how the points will decend from there.
